# Project Requirements for Arabic NER and POS Tagging
# To install all dependencies, run: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Data Handling and General Utilities
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
datasets # For easy data loading in Colab/VS Code

# NER Models
# HMM: Uses standard Python libraries (collections, math)
sklearn-crfsuite # For CRF model
seqeval # For standard NER evaluation metrics

# POS Models
# Rule-based: Uses standard Python libraries (re, collections)
# MaxEnt: Uses scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, DictVectorizer)
tensorflow # For BiLSTM model
keras # Included with tensorflow

# Transformers (for BERT model)
transformers
sentencepiece # Dependency for some tokenizers
accelerate # For faster training
torch # PyTorch is a dependency for transformers, though we use TensorFlow for BiLSTM
